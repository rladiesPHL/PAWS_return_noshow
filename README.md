# Description
After the success of the [2019 Datathon](https://github.com/rladiesPHL/2019_datathon), R-Ladies Philly Community collaborates with the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) again and aims to improve PAWS adoptions processes and clinic efficiency.

PAWS has made two different datasets available containing animal adoption data from PetPoint and clinic appointment data from ClinicHQ. We will develop analytic approaches to address following two projects:

* **Animal returns**  
PAWS has experienced a high number of returned animals. Many factors, like the time of year, size of animal, volunteer/staff who didn't prep the new adopters enough and so on, can contribute to it. This project is trying to work out the reason and help PAWS to improve adoption process to improve the situation.

* **Clinic no-shows**  
PAWS offers low cost vet services and the schedule gets crazy packed really quickly, but every day there are a bunch of no shows. The people managing the schedule have to always estimate expected noshows and overbook accordingly. This project is to provide a better sense of what drives no shows and help them more efficiently plan the schedule.


# Final Submission Format and Deadline
For each project, we are expecting one final submission made in the form of a report, similar to [2019 Datathon submission format](https://github.com/rladiesPHL/2019_datathon/blob/master/Analyses/2019_RladiesDatathon_FinalReport.pdf). All analyses should be merged into the main GitHub repo via pull and push requests once analyses and reports are complete. Since participants are welcomed to used different programming languages from R, we are open to solutions on how to integrate analyses from different languages to one report. 

The initial proposed deadline is March 1st. [Bi-weekly meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l50018W4Pmr5qfhfMp2RgtL5KfRpOhOAplMs4RPEjro/edit) will be set up when project starts.
