# PAWS_return_noshow
There are 2 sub-projects using the PAWS data

1) Dog returns: they have experienced a high number of returns and are trying to work out why (is it the time of year, size of animal, volunteer/staff perhaps didn't prep the new adopters enough, etc.)

2) Clinic no-shows: PAWS offers low cost vet services and the schedule gets crazy packed really quickly, but every day there are a bunch of no shows. The people managing the schedule have to always estimate expected noshows and overbook accordingly. A better sense of what drives no shows would help them more efficiently plan the schedule.
